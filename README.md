# Student-Engagement-Starter-Kit

The Student Engagement Starter Kit connects data from a Learning Management
System* (LMS) with the Ed-Fi ODS/API and presents a Power BI dashboard to help
teachers and administrators rapidly gain insight on student engagement with the
LMS.

\* Currently, three LMS's are supported via the [LMS
Toolkit](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/LMS-Toolkit):

1. Canvas
2. Google Classroom
3. Schoology

## Getting Started

More detail forthcoming. Requires that you have the [LMS
Toolkit](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/LMS-Toolkit) and an ODS database
from [Tech Suite 3, version
5.2](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=83798752). Other
versions may work but have not been tested.

Requires Power BI Desktop or Power BI Pro.

To change the data source from within Power BI Desktop, click on `File > Options
